Welcome to Poseidon, an underwater adventure where the ocean is both your playground and your challenge. Stranded in a shipwreck, you awaken with the ability to breathe underwater, but there’s a catch—you must keep moving, like a shark, to survive. Armed with a few essentials salvaged from a chest, your journey begins in the depths of the vast and mysterious sea.

Build your underwater realm, from coral-covered castles to sprawling aquatic cities. Explore breathtaking marine caves teeming with hidden treasures, but beware of lurking dangers like the relentless drowned and the shadowy creatures that dwell in the ocean’s depths. And then, there’s the most terrifying realm of all—the dry land above.

The air burns, and every step on land is a gamble with your life. Can you master the art of crossing worlds? Will you stay true to the sea or venture into the unknown for rare resources and unimaginable risks?

In Poseidon, the challenge is to survive, create, and thrive in this underwater odyssey. The ocean is your home. Make it extraordinary—if you can!
